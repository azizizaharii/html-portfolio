<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am studying Bachelor Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at University of Applied Science WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt and currently doing my bachelor thesis, with software development as a topic. I am really eager to dive into web and app development as a career, as programmming is my best suit during my whole degree.</p>
