<h1>The best sitcoms, according to Azizi</h1>
<h2>My top sitcoms of all-time</h2>

<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>This is the best sitcom I've ever watched. The mix of funny, friendship, relationship elements really brings out the best in every single character. RIP Matthew Perry</p>

<h3>How I Met Your Mother</h3>
<p>I really like this show because some of the quotes are just relatable and touching. Love the dynamics of the friendship, though there are some of the moments that are just annoying. Not a fan of the ending though.</p>

<h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>A really good sitcom, though some moments are just annoying. Maybe it's that way with sitcoms, huh? The character development is really strong in this one, with every character has some kind of positive growth in life.</p>
